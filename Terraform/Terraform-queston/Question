What is Infrastructure as Code?
Infrastructure as code means writing code to provision, manage and deploy IT infrastructure.

What is Terraform Provider?
A provider in Terraform is a plugin that enables interaction with an API. This includes Cloud providers and Software-as-a-service providers. 
The providers are specified in the Terraform configuration code. They tell Terraform which services it needs to interact with.
In Terraform, a provider is a plugin that enables Terraform to interact with a specific infrastructure platform or service. 
Providers are responsible for understanding the API interactions and resource lifecycle of the target platform. 
They serve as the bridge between Terraform and the underlying infrastructure, allowing Terraform to manage resources, such as virtual machines, 
databases, and networks.

What is Terraform resource type
In Terraform, a resource type represents a specific type of infrastructure object that can be managed by Terraform. 
Resources are the fundamental building blocks of a Terraform configuration, and they define the desired state of a particular piece 
of infrastructure on the target platform. 
A resource type corresponds to a specific service or component provided by a Terraform provider.
In Terraform, resources are the most important part of Terraform. Resources are defined by resource blocks. 
A resource can define one or more infrastructure resource objects, such as VPCs, virtual machines, or DNS records, Consul key-value pair data, etc.

What is Terraform state
In Terraform, the state is a crucial aspect of managing infrastructure. The state represents the current state of the resources defined in your Terraform configuration. 
It includes information about which resources are being managed, their current attribute values, and metadata needed by Terraform to orchestrate updates and 
modifications to the infrastructure.
Key characteristics of Terraform state include
Terraform state is stored in a backend, which could be a local file, a remote file (such as an S3 bucket), or a state management service 
(like Terraform Cloud). The backend is configured in the Terraform configuration or using the -backend-config option.
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}

Locking:
Terraform supports state locking to prevent multiple users or processes from modifying the state simultaneously. Locking is essential to 
prevent conflicts when multiple Terraform executions are trying to make changes concurrently. The backend determines how locking is implemented.

Sensitive Data:
Terraform state may contain sensitive information, such as passwords or private keys. To enhance security, Terraform allows marking certain 
attributes as sensitive, ensuring that their values are not displayed in the command-line output or stored in logs
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = sensitive(var.key_name)
}
In this example, the key_name attribute is marked as sensitive.

5. Explain terraform command
terraform init:
This command is used to initialize a Terraform configuration.
It downloads the provider plugins and sets up the working directory.

terraform plan:
This command is used to create an execution plan.
It compares the current state of the infrastructure (as recorded in the Terraform state) with the desired state described in your configuration files.
It provides information on what actions Terraform will take to bring the infrastructure to the desired state.

terraform apply:
This command is used to apply the changes proposed in a Terraform plan.
It executes the actions described in the execution plan to reach the desired state.
It can create, modify, or delete resources according to the configuration.

terraform state:
This command is used to interact with Terraform's state.
It provides various subcommands to manage the Terraform state, such as listing resources, moving resources, and removing resources from the state.
Let's delve into the details of terraform state and its subcommands:
terraform state list:
Lists all resources in the Terraform state.
Example: terraform state list

terraform state show:
Displays the attributes of a specific resource in the Terraform state.
Example: terraform state show aws_instance.example

terraform state mv:
Moves a resource instance from one address to another in the Terraform state.
Useful when you want to rename or reorganize your resources.
Example: terraform state mv aws_instance.old aws_instance.new

terraform state rm:
Removes a resource instance from the Terraform state.
Use with caution, as it doesn't destroy the actual resource; it just removes it from Terraform's management.
Example: terraform state rm aws_instance.example

terraform state pull:
Fetches the current state from the backend and saves it locally.
Useful when you want to see the latest state without applying changes.
Example: terraform state pull

terraform state push:
Updates the remote state with the local state.
Useful when working with remote backends like Terraform Cloud.
Example: terraform state push

terraform state refresh:
Updates the Terraform state file with the real-world infrastructure.
Fetches the latest state from the provider and updates the local state file.
Example: terraform state refresh

terraform state import:
Associates an existing resource with a Terraform resource in the state.
Allows you to import pre-existing infrastructure into Terraform management.
Example: terraform state import aws_instance.example i-0123456789abcdef0

terraform destroy:
This command is used to destroy the infrastructure defined in your Terraform configuration.
It reads the current state and figures out what resources need to be deleted to bring the infrastructure to an empty state.

terraform validate:
This command is used to validate the configuration files in the current directory.
It checks the syntax of the files and ensures that all required providers are configured.

terraform import:
This command is used to import existing infrastructure into Terraform.
It associates a Terraform resource with an existing resource in the real world, allowing Terraform to manage it.

terraform refresh:
This command is used to update the state file with the real-world infrastructure.
It reads the current state of the infrastructure and updates the state file with the latest information about resources.
These commands are fundamental to the Terraform workflow, allowing you to initialize, plan, apply, and manage infrastructure as code.

What is terraform variable
In Terraform, variables are a way to parameterize your infrastructure configuration. They allow you to define values that can be used in your Terraform configurations,
making them more flexible and reusable. Variables are typically used to abstract away values that may change between environments, deployments, or over time.


How to use terraform outputs
Terraform outputs allow you to expose information from your infrastructure configuration, making it accessible after the deployment. 
Outputs are useful for providing information about resources created by Terraform, such as IP addresses, URLs, or any other relevant data. 
Here's how you can use Terraform outputs:
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.example.id
}

output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}

What is terraform.tfvars file?
Variables.tf is for the declaration of variables, name, type, description, default values and additional meta data.
*.tfvars is for giving the actual variable values during execution. It allows you to customize the specific execution


How to reference attribute of one resource in another resource block
In Terraform, when you declare resources, you can use the outputs of one resource as input for another. Here's a more detailed explanation with a focus on AWS resources:
# Resource 1: AWS S3 Bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}

# Resource 2: AWS DynamoDB Table
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "my_table" {
  name           = "my-dynamodb-table"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  read_capacity  = 5
  write_capacity = 5

  attribute {
    name = "ID"
    type = "S"
  }

  # Reference the S3 bucket's ARN from the first resource
  tags = {
    BucketName = aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.arn
  }
}

In this example:

Resource 1 (aws_s3_bucket): Declares an AWS S3 bucket named "my-unique-bucket-name".

Resource 2 (aws_dynamodb_table): Declares an AWS DynamoDB table named "my-dynamodb-table". This resource includes a tag where the BucketName is set to 
the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the S3 bucket declared in Resource 1.
The syntax aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.arn references the arn attribute of the aws_s3_bucket resource with the name my_bucket. 
This is how you access the attributes of a resource in Terraform.
By referencing the output of the first resource (aws_s3_bucket.my_bucket.arn) in the second resource (aws_dynamodb_table.my_table), 
you're essentially telling Terraform to create a dependency between the two resources. Terraform will ensure that the S3 bucket is created before the DynamoDB table
because the DynamoDB table is using information from the S3 bucket.\
This is a basic example, and the actual attributes you reference will depend on the resources you're working with. 
Always refer to the official documentation for the specific resources and Terraform itself for accurate attribute names and usage.

 How to configure s3 backend to store state
First create S3 bucket
# Resource 1: AWS S3 Bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "your-unique-s3-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}

Then 

# backend.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "your-unique-s3-bucket-name"
    key            = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"  # Optional: Define a specific path for your state file
    region         = "your-aws-region"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "your-lock-table-name"  # Optional: Use DynamoDB for state locking
  }
}
bucket: The name of the S3 bucket where the Terraform state file will be stored.
key: The path within the bucket to store the state file. This is optional but recommended for better organization.
region: The AWS region where the S3 bucket is located.
encrypt: Set to true to enable server-side encryption of the state file.
dynamodb_table: (Optional) If you want to use DynamoDB for state locking, provide the name of the DynamoDB table.

What are the advantages of S3 Backend?
Remote State Storage:
The state file contains information about the current state of your infrastructure. By storing it in an S3 bucket, you centralize the management of this critical information. 
This is particularly useful in collaborative environments or when managing infrastructure across multiple machines.
Concurrent State Access:
Storing the state file remotely allows multiple team members to access and modify the state concurrently. This is important when working on larger projects
with multiple contributors.
Consistency and Coordination:
An S3 backend allows Terraform to use a remote storage system for the state file. This helps ensure that all team members are working with the same state, 
promoting consistency and coordination when making changes to the infrastructure.
State Locking:
The S3 backend supports state locking using DynamoDB tables. This prevents multiple users or processes from modifying the state at the same time, 
reducing the risk of conflicts and potential data corruption.
Secure Storage:
Amazon S3 provides secure and durable object storage. Using S3 as a backend ensures that your state file is stored securely and is resilient to hardware failures. 
Additionally, you can enable server-side encryption to further enhance data security.
Audit Trail:
S3 provides versioning, which allows you to track changes to the state file over time. This can be useful for auditing and understanding
the history of your infrastructure changes.
Ease of Integration with AWS Services:
If your infrastructure is primarily hosted on AWS, using an S3 backend provides seamless integration with other AWS services. You can easily manage 
access control, logging, and monitoring for your S3 bucket.
Remote Backend Configuration:
The backend configuration is stored separately from your main Terraform configurations. This makes it easier to manage sensitive information like 
access keys, secret keys, and bucket names without exposing them in your main configuration files.
Scalability:
S3 is designed for scalability and can handle large amounts of data. This makes it suitable for storing and retrieving Terraform state files, even in 
environments with extensive infrastructure.
Ease of Collaboration:
Storing the state file in an S3 bucket makes it easy to share the state among team members. This is especially beneficial in scenarios where multiple 
individuals or teams are working on different parts of the infrastructure.


Explain what is a Provider Plugin?
provider plugin refers to a specific type of plugin responsible for interacting with a particular infrastructure or service provider. 
Terraform providers are responsible for understanding API interactions and resource lifecycles for a specific platform, enabling Terraform to manage resources on that platform.


How to import existing resources into a state file
Create Terraform Configuration:
Create a new or modify an existing Terraform configuration file (usually with a .tf extension) to include the resource you 
want to import. Specify the resource type and necessary configuration settings. 
This configuration will act as a placeholder for the imported resource.
# main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # Give all the neccessary details as deatils needed when need to create new instance
}
#### Declared provider if it is not same ###
terraform init
terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <existing_resource_id>
terraform import aws_instance.example <Give id of instance>

Explain different types of provisioners used in Terraform
Provisioners in Terraform are used to execute scripts or configuration management tools on a local machine or remote resources during the deployment 
or destruction of infrastructure. Provisioners enable you to perform tasks like installing software, configuring services, or executing custom scripts 
on instances after they are created.
Local Exec Provisioner
Executes a command on the machine running Terraform (local machine).
The local-exec provisioner in Terraform is used to execute commands on the machine running Terraform (local machine) during the provisioning or destruction of infrastructure. 
It is often used for local tasks that do not require interaction with the remote resources being managed by Terraform.
Let's consider an example where you want to create a file with some content on your local machine after creating an AWS EC2 instance:
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Hello, Terraform!' > output.txt"
  }
}
The aws_instance resource defines an EC2 instance.
The local-exec provisioner is attached to the aws_instance resource.
The command parameter specifies the command to execute. In this case, it's a simple shell command that echoes
the text "Hello, Terraform!" into a file named output.txt on the local machine.

Remote Exec Provisioner:
Use Case: Executes a command on a remote resource, typically after the resource is created.
The remote-exec provisioner in Terraform is used to execute commands on a remote resource (e.g., an instance) after it has been created. 
It enables you to perform additional configuration, setup, or customization on the remote machine as part of the Terraform provisioning process. 
The remote-exec provisioner is commonly used for tasks such as installing software, configuring services, or running scripts on instances.
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx",
    ]
  }
}

2 nd Example
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    script = "path/to/configure_instance.sh"
  }
}
In this example, the remote-exec provisioner executes a script (configure_instance.sh) located on the local machine. 
The script contains the commands to be executed on the remote instance.

File Provisioner
Use Case: Copies files or directories from the local machine to a remote resource.
The file provisioner in Terraform is used to copy files or directories from the local machine (where Terraform is executed) to a remote resource 
after it has been created. This provisioner is helpful when you need to transfer configuration files, scripts, or other assets to a newly provisioned instance or resource.
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "local/path/to/script.sh"
    destination = "/remote/path/script.sh"
  }
}



Explain modules?
With Terraform, you can put your code inside of a Terraform module and reuse that module in multiple places throughout your code. 
Instead of having the same code copied and pasted in the staging and production environments, you’ll be able to have both environments reuse code from the same module:
