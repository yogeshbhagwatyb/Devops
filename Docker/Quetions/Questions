What is Container?
A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything which needed to run software, including the code, 
runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers provide a consistent and portable environment across different computing environments, making it easier to develop, deploy, 
and scale applications.
Containers can run on any system that supports containerization, making them highly portable. This portability is achieved through the use of container runtimes and orchestration tools.
Containers share the host operating system's kernel, which makes them more lightweight and efficient compared to traditional virtual machines. They start up quickly and consume fewer resources.
