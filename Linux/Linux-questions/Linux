How to check schedule jobs
crontab -l

If cron job did not work how would you check
check system time
crontab entry
check /var/log/messages

To check services
sudo systemctl status jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
sudo systemctl stop jenkins

To see free disk
df -h = Disk Free/Filesystem in Human readable format
df -k = Show in kilobyte
df -BG = Show in gigabyte
du -sh /home/ubuntu = Disk Usage of Summary of specified directory rather than all in Human redable format
du -h /home/ubuntu = Same as above

To find folders
find /path/to/search -type d -name "folder_name"
find /etc -type d -name "sshd" = d directory 
find / -type f -name "filename.txt"
find /home/ubuntu -type f -name "1.txt" = f file

How to check cpu usage for a process
ps aux = To see detail view of process
top = To see utilization and monitoring
PID (Process ID): This column displays a unique identifier assigned to each process by the operating system. Every process running on the system has a PID, which is used to identify and manage it.

USER: This column shows the username of the user who launched the process. It helps identify which users are running which processes on the system.

PR (Priority): The priority of the process determines its importance in the system's scheduling algorithm. Processes with higher priorities are given more CPU time. Lower values indicate higher priority.

NI (Nice value): The nice value is used to adjust the priority of a process. It ranges from -20 to 19, with lower values indicating higher priority. Processes with higher nice values are less likely to get CPU time, allowing them to run in the background without affecting foreground tasks.

VIRT (Virtual Memory Usage): This column displays the total virtual memory used by the process. It includes all memory the process can access, including shared libraries and memory-mapped files.

RES (Resident Memory Usage): Resident memory usage represents the portion of physical memory (RAM) currently allocated to the process and actively being used.

SHR (Shared Memory Size): This column shows the amount of shared memory used by the process. Shared memory is memory that can be accessed by multiple processes, typically used for inter-process communication.

%CPU (Percentage of CPU Usage): This column displays the percentage of CPU time consumed by the process since the last update of top. It indicates the amount of CPU resources the process is using relative to the total available CPU resources.

%MEM (Percentage of Memory Usage): This column shows the percentage of physical memory (RAM) used by the process relative to the total available memory on the system.

TIME+ (Total CPU Time): This column displays the total CPU time consumed by the process since it started. It includes both user-mode and kernel-mode CPU time.

COMMAND: This column shows the command name or full path of the executable associated with the process. It helps identify what each process is doing based on the command it's running.

Options
Quit top (q): Pressing q will quit the top command and return you to the terminal prompt.

Kill a process by specifying its PID (k): Press k and then enter the PID (Process ID) of the process you want to kill. After entering the PID, press Enter, and then confirm the action by typing y or Y and pressing Enter again.

Change the priority of a process (r): Press r and then enter the PID of the process for which you want to change the priority. After entering the PID, press Enter, and then you will be prompted to enter the new priority value. Once you've entered the new priority value, press Enter again to confirm the change.

Filter processes by a specific user (u): Press u and then enter the username of the user whose processes you want to filter. After entering the username, press Enter, and top will display only the processes associated with that user.

Sort processes by memory usage (M): Press M to sort the processes by memory usage, with the process using the most memory listed first.

Sort processes by CPU usage (P): Press P to sort the processes by CPU usage, with the process using the most CPU listed first.

Sort processes by PID (N): Press N to sort the processes by PID (Process ID), with the lowest PID listed first.

Select and toggle display of specific fields (f): Press f to bring up a menu that allows you to select and toggle the display of specific fields in the process list. Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu, press Space to select or deselect a field, and press Enter to apply your changes.

Using pgrep Command: If you know the name of the process, you can use pgrep to find the PID. For example, to find the PID of the nginx process:
pgrep process name
pgrep nginx

To see or find the particular process
ps aux | grep nginx

To delete some process
ps aux = from here we can get PID
kill PID

Networking
netstat = Network Statatics
netstat -nr = netstat -n to display Numerical address and r to display kernal Routing table
Overall, netstat -nr provides a snapshot of the current routing table in the system,

netstat -putn 
-putn: These are options (flags) that modify the behavior of the netstat command:
-p: This option tells netstat to display the process ID (PID) and the name of the program that owns each socket or network connection.
-u: This option tells netstat to display UDP (User Datagram Protocol) connections.
-t: This option tells netstat to display TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connections.
-n: This option tells netstat to display numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames and service names. It prevents netstat from performing DNS resolution, which can speed up the command's execution.
 
netstat -putn | grep :22 = to find particulary :22 connection

Password authentication file
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

Sudoers file to give permission
/etc/sudoers = user1   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

SSH from another sever
Server1
adduser user1 = Create user
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config = Yes on Password authentication
sudo systemctl restart sshd = Reload sshd
Server2 
ssh user@Server1publicip

SCP
Secure Copy file and directiories between local and remote or two remote system
scp -i /path/to/private_key.pem /path/to/local/file.txt user@remote_host:/path/to/destination

To zip and unzip file
gzip filename
gunzip filename

To zip and unzip folders
In this we have to zip folder by using command tar and then it will craete file and we need to craete zip file from this and final output of file is myfile.tar.gz
tar cvf file.tar newfolder = Tape ARchive Create an archive Versbose Filename of the archive 
-c: This option specifies that you want to create an archive.
-v: This option stands for "verbose" and will display a list of files being archived.
-f: This option allows you to specify the filename of the archive.
tar cvf (entername before .tar which you to craete file) (folder name which you want to compressed)

tar xvf file.tar = EXtract
tar xvf (File which you want unzip)
############################################################################################
In this we have to zip folder by using command tar and then it will craete file and we need to craete zip file from this
But we can do it by single command
tar -zcvf myfile.tgz myfolder = gZip
tar -zcvf (entername before .tgz which you to craete file) (folder name which you want to compressed)
tar -zxvf myfile.tgz myfolder = gZip
