Explain what is AWS EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers, known as instances,
in the cloud. AWS EC2 provides scalable compute capacity, allowing users to quickly scale up or down based on their computing needs. It's a fundamental 
building block of many cloud-based applications and services.
Key features of AWS EC2 include:
Virtual Servers (Instances):
Users can launch virtual servers, known as instances, with varying compute capacity based on their requirements. Instances can run different operating 
systems, including popular ones like Linux and Windows.
Instance Types:
EC2 offers a variety of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, and GPU instances.
Users can choose the instance type that best suits their application's needs.
Scalability:
Users can easily scale their compute capacity up or down by launching or terminating instances. This allows for flexibility in handling changes in workload or
demand.
Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:
EC2 follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, meaning users are billed only for the compute capacity they consume. There are various pricing options, including On-Demand
Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.
Elastic Load Balancing:
EC2 instances can be used in conjunction with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and fault
tolerance.
AMI (Amazon Machine Image):
Users can create custom virtual machine images, called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which include pre-configured software and settings. AMIs can be used to launch instances
with a consistent setup.
Security Groups and Networking:
EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and users can configure security groups and network settings to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
Elastic Block Store (EBS):
EC2 instances can be attached to Elastic Block Store volumes, providing scalable and high-performance block storage that persists independently from the life of the instance.
Integration with AWS Services:
EC2 instances can seamlessly integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3 for storage, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon RDS for managed relational databases.
Auto Scaling:
AWS Auto Scaling allows users to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on defined policies. This ensures that the application can handle varying levels of traffic and demand.
AWS EC2 is a foundational service that enables users to run virtual servers in the cloud, providing flexibility, scalability, and a wide range of options for different computing needs.
