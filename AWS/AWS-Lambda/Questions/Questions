Explain what is AWS EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers, known as instances,
in the cloud. AWS EC2 provides scalable compute capacity, allowing users to quickly scale up or down based on their computing needs. It's a fundamental 
building block of many cloud-based applications and services.
Key features of AWS EC2 include:
Virtual Servers (Instances):
Users can launch virtual servers, known as instances, with varying compute capacity based on their requirements. Instances can run different operating 
systems, including popular ones like Linux and Windows.
Instance Types:
EC2 offers a variety of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, and GPU instances.
Users can choose the instance type that best suits their application's needs.
Scalability:
Users can easily scale their compute capacity up or down by launching or terminating instances. This allows for flexibility in handling changes in workload or
demand.
Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:
EC2 follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model, meaning users are billed only for the compute capacity they consume. There are various pricing options, including On-Demand
Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.
Elastic Load Balancing:
EC2 instances can be used in conjunction with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances, ensuring high availability and fault
tolerance.
AMI (Amazon Machine Image):
Users can create custom virtual machine images, called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which include pre-configured software and settings. AMIs can be used to launch instances
with a consistent setup.
Security Groups and Networking:
EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and users can configure security groups and network settings to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.
Elastic Block Store (EBS):
EC2 instances can be attached to Elastic Block Store volumes, providing scalable and high-performance block storage that persists independently from the life of the instance.
Integration with AWS Services:
EC2 instances can seamlessly integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3 for storage, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon RDS for managed relational databases.
Auto Scaling:
AWS Auto Scaling allows users to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on defined policies. This ensures that the application can handle varying levels of traffic and demand.
AWS EC2 is a foundational service that enables users to run virtual servers in the cloud, providing flexibility, scalability, and a wide range of options for different computing needs.

What is AMI â€“ Amazon Machine Image?
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured virtual machine image, which is used to create and launch instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) environment. An 
AMI contains all the necessary information to launch a specific instance, including the operating system, application server, and applications.
AMIs can be created from existing instances or custom-built from scratch, and they serve as a foundation for launching virtual servers in the AWS cloud.
Key components of an AMI include:
Root Volume:
The root volume is the primary storage device where the operating system and other essential components are installed.
Block Device Mapping:
AMIs include information about the block device mappings, which define the volumes to be attached to an instance when it is launched.
Launch Permissions:
AMIs can have launch permissions that specify which AWS accounts are allowed to use the AMI to launch instances.
AMIs can be public, private, or shared. Public AMIs are available to anyone, private AMIs are only accessible to the owner's AWS account, and shared AMIs can be shared with specific
AWS accounts. AMIs are a fundamental building block in the AWS cloud computing ecosystem, enabling users to quickly and efficiently launch virtual servers with predefined configurations.

What is Security Group in AWS?
In Amazon Web Services (AWS), a Security Group is a virtual firewall for your instances. It acts as a set of rules that control the traffic 
coming in and going out of your virtual machines, known as EC2 instances. The primary purpose of a Security Group is to enhance the security
of your AWS resources by regulating network access.
Key Aspects of AWS Security Groups:
Virtual Firewall:
A Security Group is like a protective barrier around your EC2 instances, allowing you to dictate which types of traffic are permitted or denied.
Traffic Rules:
It operates based on rules that you define. You specify what kinds of traffic (such as HTTP, HTTPS, SSH) are allowed to reach your instances 
and what traffic is not allowed.
Inbound and Outbound Traffic:
You can set rules for both inbound traffic (coming into your instances) and outbound traffic (going out from your instances).
Stateful Filtering:
Security Groups are stateful, meaning if you allow incoming traffic for a particular connection, the corresponding outgoing traffic for the
response is automatically allowed.
Applied at Instance Level:
Each EC2 instance is associated with one or more Security Groups. The rules defined in these groups apply to the specific instances they are 
associated with.
Protocol and Port-Based Rules:
Rules are defined based on protocols (like TCP, UDP, ICMP) and port numbers. For example, you might open port 80 for web traffic.
Default Deny:
By default, all inbound traffic is denied. You explicitly specify which types of traffic should be allowed.
Dynamic and Immediate:
Changes to Security Group rules take effect immediately, and they are dynamically applied to instances associated with the Security Group.

Why Security Groups are Stateful?
Security Groups in AWS are stateful, which means they keep track of the state of the connections and automatically allow the return traffic 
for permitted inbound connections. The statefulness of Security Groups simplifies network security management and ensures a more 
straightforward and secure configuration. Here's why Security Groups are designed to be stateful:
Ease of Configuration:
Stateful Security Groups make it easier to configure and manage network security. When you allow inbound traffic for a specific connection,
the corresponding outbound traffic for the response is automatically allowed.
Automatic Handling of Return Traffic:
When you allow traffic to come into your EC2 instance, Security Groups automatically track the state of the connection. This means that when 
the response goes back out from your instance, it is allowed without needing an explicit outbound rule.
Reduced Configuration Errors:
The stateful nature reduces the chances of configuration errors. You don't need to create separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic for 
the same connection.
Simplified Rule Sets:
Stateful Security Groups allow you to define rules based on your desired traffic patterns without the need to manage complex bidirectional 
rules. This simplifies the rule sets and makes them more intuitive.
Enhanced Security:
By automatically allowing return traffic for established connections, Security Groups contribute to a more secure environment. It ensures that 
legitimate responses to authorized inbound traffic are permitted.
Better Support for Dynamic Environments:
In dynamic cloud environments where instances may change or scale based on demand, stateful Security Groups adapt to these changes seamlessly. 
They dynamically adjust to the state of the connections without requiring constant rule updates.
Scalability:
As your infrastructure scales and you add more instances, the stateful nature of Security Groups helps maintain a consistent and secure 
communication flow, regardless of the number of instances involved.
In summary, the statefulness of AWS Security Groups simplifies the management of network security by automatically handling return traffic for 
permitted connections. This design choice enhances security, reduces configuration complexity, and supports dynamic and scalable cloud 
environments.
